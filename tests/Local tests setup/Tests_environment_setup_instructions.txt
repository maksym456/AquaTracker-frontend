A. From file explorer 

1. Open the tests folder in Windows Explorer.
2. Find Tests_setup.bat
3. Double-click it.
4. A black command window will open and you will see the whole process live.


B. From cmd

2. Run the file by typing in  .\Tests_setup.bat
3. A black command window will open and you will see the whole process live.


Once the setup passsed without fail you can run the tests via console.
